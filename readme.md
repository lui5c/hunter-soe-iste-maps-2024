*In lieu of a readme, read about this code at https://agileteacherlab.org/hunter/soe-iste-maps-2024/how-to-curriculum-map.*

The raw data from which the cleaned and anonymized data was created of course omitted from this repository. 

The purpose of this repository is to show the process:
1. clean the data
2. format the data in a way that can be read conveniently by the website (JSON)
3. set up a format for programmatic generation of charts, graphs, tables etc. based on that JSON
